* Implement a change-log for every action performed on a Picture or Repo
  instance. This could be achieved by providing a method decorator that does
  the necessary logging to a history log. Every log entry should consist of the
  method call with arguments (Python executable), a description of the action
  and the method call (with arguments) needed to undo the action.
  
  T.ex. in Repo
  
  @track_history(action='add(...)', descr=('added picture to index'),
  				 undo_action='del(...)')
  def add(self, picture):
  	<...> 



* Possibility to split & merge repositories


* Keep track of deleted pictures, so that clones can be updated
