workflow.

Execute PictureClerk like this::

    #!/usr/bin/env bash

This will print some information about the various PictureClerk commands:


Backup
======
Clone the current repository to (multiple) backup location(s).
    
Usage:
  
    #!/usr/bin/env/bash
    pic backup [PATH] [PATH] ...
    
Example:

    #!/usr/bin/env/bash
    pic backup /mnt/backup/photos ssh://server/backup/pics

At each provided backup location PictureClerk creates a directory with the
name of the repository, and then clones the repository into it.
If the repository from the example above were located at 
/home/user/photos/holidaypics, PictureClerk would create 2 clones at:
- /mnt/backup/photos/holidaypics on the local filesystem
- /backup/pics/holidaypics on the remote host "server"
